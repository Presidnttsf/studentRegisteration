express → Framework to build APIs
cors → Allows React to communicate with Node.js (CORS policy)
mongoose → Connects to MongoDB
dotenv → Loads environment variables

What is Express.js?
Express.js is a fast, minimal, and flexible Node.js web framework.
It helps in building backend APIs and web applications easily.
Provides powerful routing, middleware support, and simplifies handling requests & responses.

What is Mongoose?
Mongoose is an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB in Node.js.
It helps in interacting with MongoDB using JavaScript objects instead of raw queries.
Provides schema-based structure to define how data should be stored in MongoDB.


CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security mechanism implemented by web browsers to restrict web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. In the context of React applications, CORS is crucial when the application needs to communicate with a backend API hosted on a different domain.

Introduction to dotenv
Explaining why we need dotenv in backend development:

When building applications, we often use sensitive data like database credentials, API keys, or secret tokens.
Storing these directly in the code is unsafe and can lead to security issues if shared publicly.
The .env file helps us store such sensitive information securely and separately.
